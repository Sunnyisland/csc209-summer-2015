<h2 id="introdution">Introdution</h2>
<p>The library functions and system calls that implement dynamic memory allocation
operate on a contiguous region of memory called the <em>heap</em>. Your task is to
implement simple versions of
<em><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc(3)</a></em> and
<em><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">free(3)</a></em> called
<code>malloc209</code> and <code>free209</code>. These two functions operate nearly the same way as
<em>malloc</em> and <em>free</em> do: <code>malloc209</code> makes memory available for use (it
<em>allocates memory</em>) and <code>free209</code> releases, or <em>frees</em>, that memory back into
the heap pool once you are done with it. One difference between <em>free</em> and your
<code>free209</code> is that your version will return an integer status code: 0 on
success, and -1 on error (the usual <em>free</em> has a <code>void</code> return type, and thus
does not return a value.)</p>
<h2 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h2>
<p>Before you can start the assignment, you <strong>MUST</strong> download the starter code and
commit it to your Subversion repository under the <code>a2</code> directory. You can
access the code by 3 means:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="a2_files/csc209h1y_2015-a2_starter_code-r1.tar">By downloading a tarball</a> (current revision <strong>1</strong>): from the CDF shell, you can use <em><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/wget.1.html">wget(1)</a></em> followed by this URL to download the archive to your current working directory.</li>
<li><a href="a2_files/a2_starter_code/">From the course website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pdmccormick/csc209-summer-2015/tree/master/assignments/a2_files/a2_starter_code">From the course GitHub repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whichever method you prefer, ensure that you have all <strong>6</strong> files of the
starter code.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2>
<p>The starter code provided will compile without warning or error (simply type
<code>make</code> from the shell), but it will not function correctly until you implement
the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>void heap209_init(size_t heap_size)</code></strong>: (<strong>5%</strong>) Initialize the memory and metadata that manage the dynamic memory allocation of the heap. Part of this function has been provided for you, using the <em><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap(2)</a></em> system call to arrange a large contiguous region of memory for heap storage (see the comments in <em>heap209.c</em> for some further explanation about this interesting system call.) You <strong>MUST</strong> use the standard library function <em>malloc</em> to allocate and initialize the linked list global variables, which are of type <code>Chunk</code>, a typedef'd struct defined in <em><a href="https://github.com/pdmccormick/csc209-summer-2015/tree/master/assignments/a2_files/a2_starter_code/heap209.h#L20">heap209.h</a></em>.</li>
<li><strong><code>void heap209_cleanup(void)</code></strong>: (<strong>10%</strong>) Uses the standard library function <em>free</em> to release <strong>all</strong> the dynamically allocated memory used by the heap metadata (the <code>alloc_list</code> and <code>free_list</code> structures), thus in effect destroying the heap. This function <strong>MUST</strong> be called prior to program exiting. <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> <strong>MUST</strong> report <code>all heap memory freed</code>, otherwise you have forgotten to free something and thus have a memory leak (see below for details on using Valgrind.)</li>
<li><strong><code>void *malloc209(size_t nbytes)</code></strong>: (<strong>30%</strong>) Reserves <code>nbytes</code> of memory from within the heap region (as initialized by <code>heap209_init</code>.) If the allocation is successfully, a <em>void pointer</em> to the newly reserved memory will be returned. If the allocation fails for any reason (for example, if there is insufficient free space to accomodate the request), <code>NULL</code> shall be returned.</li>
<li><strong><code>int free209(void *addr)</code></strong>: (<strong>30%</strong>) Releases the memory pointed to by <code>addr</code> back to the heap for reuse in fulfilling future allocations. If <code>addr</code> is not the address of any currently allocated chunk of the heap, <code>free209</code> shall return <em>-1</em>. If it succeeds, it shall return <em>0</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three global variables that together represent the heap memory region
and its associated metadata (forward declarations using <code>extern</code> are available
from the
<em><a href="https://github.com/pdmccormick/csc209-summer-2015/tree/master/assignments/a2_files/a2_starter_code/heap209.h#L35">heap209.h</a></em>
header, and their actual definition is in <em><a href="https://github.com/pdmccormick/csc209-summer-2015/tree/master/assignments/a2_files/a2_starter_code/heap209.c#L16">heap209.c</a></em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>heap_region</code></strong>: a <em>void</em> pointer to the starting address of the heap memory region reserved by <code>heap209_init</code>.</li>
<li><strong><code>free_list</code></strong>: a linked list of type <code>Chunk</code> (a typedef'd structure) that delineate the portions of the heap region that are <em>not</em> allocated, and are thus free (available) for use via allocation. Chunks in this list <strong>MUST</strong> be stored in increasing address order.</li>
<li><strong><code>alloc_list</code></strong>: similar to <code>free_list</code>, but instead of storing unallocated chunks of the heap, this list stores the chunks that were previously allocated through a call to <code>malloc209</code>. Chunks in this list <strong>MUST</strong> be stored in increasing address order.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of the <code>heap_region</code> as a large array of bytes, and it is your
responsibility to partition it up into chunks when <code>malloc209</code> is called. The
<em>metadata</em> associated with this heap are the two linked list of chunks, those
allocated (currently in use) and those free (unused and thus available for
allocation.) To complete <code>heap209_init</code>, you need to create the first chunk
with address and size associated with the whole <code>heap_region</code>. After
<code>heap209_init</code> completes, the <code>alloc_list</code> should be empty but initialized, and
the <code>free_list</code> should contain one chunk representing the whole heap.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the state of memory after <code>heap209_init</code> has
initialized the heap region and associated metadata:</p>
<p><img alt="The state of memory after heap209_init has been called. heap_region points to the starting address of the space reserved by mmap. free_list points to a single node where the addr field holds the same value as heap_region, and the size field is the amount of memory reserved by mmap" src="a2_files/0-heap_init.png"></p>
<p>When <code>malloc209(nbytes)</code> is called, is searches the <code>free_list</code> for a chunk
that is <em>at least</em> <code>nbytes</code> in size. There are two possibilities if it finds
such a chunk: the chunk might be exactly the required size (<code>size == nbytes</code>),
or the chunk might be larger than required. If the chunk found has a <code>size</code>
that is larger than <code>nbytes</code>, then it will split the block into two. The first,
containing the address and size of the allocated chunk, is placed in the
<code>alloc_list</code> (such that the list remains in order of ascending addresses),
representing the successful allocation that <em>malloc209</em> has just made. The
second chunk will contain the remaining free (unallocated) memory that was
beyond what was required, and this chunk will stay in the <code>free_list</code>.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a test program that makes the following three calls to
<code>malloc209</code>. The state of the heap metadata is shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">malloc209</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">malloc209</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">24</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">malloc209</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="The free_list has one chunk with address 0x7f6082008048 and size 13100. The alloc_list has three chunks: address 0x7f6082008000 with size 16, address 0x7f6082008010 with size 24, and address 0x7f6082008028 with size 32." src="a2_files/1-three_mallocs.png"></p>
<p>The next diagram shows the state of the metadata data after the following call
to <code>free209</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">free209</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ptrs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="The free_list has tho chunks with address 0x7f6082008048 with size 13100, and address 0x7f6082008010 with size 24. The alloc_list has two chunks: address 0x7f6082008000 with size 16, and address 0x7f6082008028 with size 32." src="a2_files/2-one_free.png"></p>
<h2 id="testing-10">Testing <strong>(10%)</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to completing the four functions to implement the dynamic memory
system, you will also write one test program in
<code>test-<em>CDF_USER</em>.c</code> (where the characters <em>CDF_USER</em>
should be substituted for your actual CDF account username) that tests your
functions. You may use <code>test-basic1.c</code> as a guide for how to write a test, but
your program <strong>MUST</strong> demonstrate an interesting test case. Determining what
makes an interesting case is a judgement call you need to make, and part of
what we are marking.  Your <code>test-<em>CDF_USER</em>.c</code> program
<strong>MUST</strong> include a comment at the top of the file explaining the scenario that
is under test and why you think it is interesting. Feel free to add additional
diagnostics and sanity checks to the code.</p>
<p>To make <code>test-basic1.c</code> fully functional, you will need to complete the <code>show_list</code>
function in <code>diagnostics.c</code>.</p>
<h2 id="makefile-5">Makefile <strong>(5%)</strong></h2>
<p>Add a rule (or rules) to the <code>Makefile</code> to properly build an executable called
<code>test-<em>CDF_USER</em></code> (again, substituting <em>CDF_USER</em> for your
username.)</p>
<p>Add another rule to the <code>Makefile</code> with the target <strong>tests</strong> and the
prerequisites <code>test-basic1</code> and <code>test-<em>CDF_USER</em></code> that runs
both test programs.</p>
<h2 id="valgrind">Valgrind</h2>
<p><a href="http://valgrind.org">Valgrind</a> is an incredibly powerful tool that can automatically detect certain kinds of memory errors and misbehaviours within your programs. For this assignment you are to use it to check and ensure that your program is not leaking any memory (i.e. chunk metadata than you <em>malloc</em> but forget or are unable to later <em>free</em>.)</p>
<p>Run it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> valgrind ./test-basic1
</pre></div>


<p>The output will include the output from the <code>test-basic1</code> program itself, as well as a output from Valgrind that will be prefixed with lines like <code>==33880==</code> (the number, which is the <em>process identifier</em> or <em>pid</em> of the execution of the program, will vary, but the general format will remain the same.) The most useful piece of information from Valgrind will come at the end in the form of a <em>heap summary</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>==33880==
==33880== HEAP SUMMARY:
==33880==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==33880==   total heap usage: 6 allocs, 6 frees, 144 bytes allocated
==33880==
==33880== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==33880==
==33880== For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -v
==33880== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 2 from 2)
</pre></div>


<p>The critical message that you want to see is <code>All heap blocks were freed -- no
leaks are possible</code> (the suppressed errors are not important.) If your program
inadvertently leaks memory (some pointers returned by <em>malloc</em> are never passed
to <em>free</em> before program termination), you will see a summary that looks
something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>==34248== HEAP SUMMARY:
==34248==     in use at exit: 1,000 bytes in 1 blocks
==34248==   total heap usage: 7 allocs, 6 frees, 1,144 bytes allocated
==34248==
==34248== LEAK SUMMARY:
==34248==    definitely lost: 1,000 bytes in 1 blocks
==34248==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==34248==      possibly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==34248==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==34248==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==34248== Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory
</pre></div>


<p>Here we are being told that the pointer returned by a <code>malloc(1000)</code> call was
never passed to <code>free</code> before the program terminated, and that the memory was
most certainly lost because the program had no pointers to it that memory
anywhere at all (it was the case that we simply forgot to call <em>free</em>, but that
we would have been unable to even if we had wanted.) Other kinds of memory
leaks will be reported differently, so read the leak summary carefully.</p>
<h2 id="code-quality-10">Code Quality <strong>(10%)</strong></h2>
<p>The quality of the code you write is always important. Use clear variable
names, consistent and readable formatting, informative comments that are not
pedantic, and generally apply good design and human communication principles.</p>
<p>Since what constitutes <em>good</em> design is highly subjective, feel free to solicit
advice from the course staff and consider further developing your own aesthetic
taste.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-submit">What to Submit</h2>
<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> begin this assignment by checking in all of the starter code under
the <code>a2</code> directory within your repository. This includes all <code>.c</code> source code
files, <code>.h</code> header files and the <code>Makefile</code>.</p>
<p>As you proceed, make sure that you run <code>svn add</code> on every new file you add.
Feel free to include in your repository whatever else you deem worthy.</p>
<p>If you forget to add a file or forget to commit a change, there is nothing that
the course staff will be able to do for you.</p>
<p>You should be able to run <code>valgrind ./test-basic1</code> and see the message <code>All
heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible</code>, while also seeing the correct
output from the program itself.</p>
<h2 id="submission-checklist">Submission Checklist</h2>
<p>Commit early and commit often (at least every 2-3 hours that you spend working
on the assignment.) Consider this as insurance against any last minute SVN
problems, or against possibly missing a deadline.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things that you should do on the CDF server at least an hour
before the assignment deadline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new temporary directory in your account (different from the one you are working on the assignment from, and not even a subdirectory within that one)</li>
<li>Check out a fresh copy of your repository into this empty directory</li>
<li>Ensure that all the correct files have been committed, and that they are the latest versions you expected them to be</li>
<li>Run <code>make</code> and ensure that at least <code>test-basic1</code> compiles without warnings or errors.</li>
<li>Run <code>./test-basic1</code>, as well as your own test programs, to be sure that everything works as expected.</li>
<li>Run <code>valgrind ./test-basic1</code>, as well as Valgrind on your own test programs, to make sure that no memory is left allocated in the heap at the end of the program run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that your submission <strong>MUST</strong> compile and run correctly on CDF,
without exception.</p>

    <h1>CSC209 Course Syllabus &mdash; Summer 2015</h1>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to CSC209: Software Tools and Systems Programming. The course is designed to introduce software techniques and tools used in a Unix/Linux environment. We will study C, a low-level programming language, and use it to examine the interface between the operating system and user-level programs.</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Textbooks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>King, <em><a href="http://knking.com/books/c2/index.html">C Programming: A Modern Approach</a></em>. W. W. Norton and Company, 2008 (highly recommended)</li>
<li>Kerrisk, <em><a href="http://man7.org/tlpi/index.html">Linux Programming Interface</a></em>. No Starch Press, 2010 (<a href="http://man7.org/tlpi/errata/index.html">errata</a>)</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Website and Discussion Board</strong>: The course website contains lecture notes, assignment handouts, and, most importantly, a link to the <a href="https://piazza.com/utoronto.ca/summer2015/csc209/">Piazza discussion board</a>. The board can get you fast, accurate response to your questions – but it only works if everyone participates! We will also use the boards to post announcements and updates, so Piazza is required daily reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Email</strong>: Please use email for personal issues and the discussion board for all other course-related questions. I try to respond to email by the end of the next day. However, due to volume, it may take longer, especially on weekends (I am often not able to answer email more than once on the weekend.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anonymous Feedback</strong>: If you have feedback about the course, the course web page includes a <a href="feedback.html">link to an anonymous email form</a>. (You also have the option of including your name.) Since the sender cannot be determined, comments sent through the feedback system are considered public, and they may receive a response at the beginning of class or on Piazza.</p>

<p>To pass the course you must receive at least 40% on the final exam. The highest mark you will receive if your grade on the final exam is less than 40% is 47%.</p>
<p><strong>Any section of an assignment in which the C program does not compile on CDF <em>will receive a grade of 0</em>. If you can explain clearly in a remarking request how to fix the problem, your program will be remarked with a 20% penalty. Errors in submission such as missing files, incorrectly named files, putting files in the wrong place may be graded with a 20% penalty.</strong></p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Late Work</strong>: All assignments are submitted electronically and are due at <strong>10 p.m. sharp</strong> on the due date (with the sole exception being for Assignment 4, which is due at 11:59 p.m. on the due date.) Each student begins the semester with three grace day tokens.<ul>
<li>At most two grace days may be used for a single assignment. </li>
<li>Submitting an assignment up to 1 day (24 hours) late uses one token. Submitting an assignment up to 2 days (48 hours) late uses two tokens. Once your tokens have been used late assignments will not be accepted.</li>
<li>Grace days may not be used for labs.</li>
<li>Grace days may not be used for Assignment 4.</li>
<li>Please note that 10:01 p.m. will be considered late (or 12:00am for A4), therefore ensure that your work is not submitted at the very last second. Because you will be using version control, it is very easy to commit regularly to avoid running into the deadline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remarking requests that result from incorrect submissions will receive a 20% penalty.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Religious Holidays</strong>: If a religious holiday will keep you from completing any assigned work, please let me know as soon as possible (but no later than two weeks before the due date), and we will work out a mutually agreeable accommodation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emergencies</strong>: In the event of an illness or other catastrophe, obtain appropriate documentation (e.g., medical certificate) and contact me by email within 48 hours of the due date. It is always easier to make alternate arrangements before a due date, so please inform me as soon as you know that you will need accommodation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Re-mark Requests</strong>: If a piece of work has been mis-marked or if you believe the rubric used to evaluate the work is not appropriate, you may request a re-mark. For a re-mark to succeed, you must clearly and concisely express what you believe was mis-marked. To request a re-mark, use the form for the assignment on <a href="https://markus.cdf.toronto.edu/csc209-2015-05/">MarkUs</a>. Requests must be submitted within 2 weeks of the marks being returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Integrity</strong>: All of the work you submit must be done by you and your work must not be submitted by someone else. Plagiarism is academic fraud and is taken very seriously. The department uses software that compares programs for evidence of similar code. Please read the <a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm">Rules and Regulations</a> from the U of T Calendar (especially the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters). Here are a couple of guidelines to help you avoid plagiarism: </p>
<ul>
<li>Never look at another student's or group's assignment solution or idea for a solution, whether it is on paper or on the computer screen, and don't allow your solution to be viewed by or come into the possession of another student.</li>
<li>Maintain absolute control of your work – including notes and partial solutions – at all times. </li>
<li>We encourage you to discuss course concepts and to study for exams with other students, but any work that is submitted should be your own. The easiest way to avoid plagiarism is to only discuss submitted work with your partner or the instructor.</li>
<li>Similarly, Google (and Wikipedia) may help you with course material, but do not use the internet to look for solutions to the assignment problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility Needs</strong>: The University of Toronto is committed to accessibility. If you require accommodations for a disability, or have any accessibility concerns about the course, the classroom or course materials, please contact Accessibility Services as soon as possible: <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#97;&#99;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#105;&#98;&#105;&#108;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#117;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#97;">&#97;&#99;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#115;&#105;&#98;&#105;&#108;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#46;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#118;&#105;&#99;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#117;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#111;&#46;&#99;&#97;</a> or <a href="http://www.accessibility.utoronto.ca/">http://www.accessibility.utoronto.ca/</a>.</p>
